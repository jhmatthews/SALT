	% Immediate objectives.
	\ImmediateObjectives{ 
	Our objective is to use the wide-band spectrum for direct comparison with our radiative transfer simulations. 
	By obtaining spectra at a variety of inclinations we will be able to test for the presence or otherwise 
	of a Balmer jump in emission or absorption, discover trends in line emission strengths and profile shapes
	across the Balmer series, and assess the Helium emission. Combined with our theoretical work, 
	this will provide a unique insight into how much the disk wind affects the optical spectra of CVs.

	% Technical justification.
	\TechnicalJustification{
		% Insert your technical justification here.
		In their normal state, RW Sextantis, IX Velorium and UU Aquarii have optical V band magnitudes of 
		$9.9$, $9.0$ and $13.3$ respectively (Ritter \& Kolb 2003).
		We require ${\rm SNR} \geq 30$ for all objects, but fortunately this is easily achievable with
		time budgets still being dominated by overheads. In total, we estimate 198.3 seconds of 
		total time (exposure plus overheads) for UU Aqr, and ?? and ?? for RW Sex and IX Vel respectively.

		We will be using RSS in long slit mode. Will will use the pg2300 grating which 
		provides coverage from ??? to ??? with a high enough spectral resolution. 
		We suggest the following grating angles, to be repeated for {\bf each} observation

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Camera Station $60.25^\circ$, Grating angle $48.875^\circ$. Simulation file uuaqr\_blue.rsim.
		\item Camera Station $70.75^\circ$, Grating angle $29.375^\circ$. Simulation file uuaqr\_mid.rsim.
		\item Camera Station $85.0^\circ$, Grating angle $39.125^\circ$. Simulation file uuaqr\_mid2.rsim.
		\item Camera Station $98.5^\circ$, Grating angle $49.25^\circ$. Simulation file uuaqr\_red.rsim.
		\end{itemize}

		These grating settings provide coverage from $\lambda 3505\AA- \lambda 6949 \AA$.
		This set of observations has a combined exposure time of ?? and overheads of ?? leading to a total ?? of time, and obtains 
		${\rm SNR} \geq 30$ for all observations, and ${\rm SNR} \sim 100$ in the majority of cases.
